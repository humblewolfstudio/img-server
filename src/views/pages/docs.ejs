    <h1>Getting started</h1>
    <p>The first step is create an account <a href="/register">here</a></p>
    <p>Then you have two options, you can upload the images directly from the <a href="/dashboard">dashboard</a> or you can use the <a href="/dashboard?c=3">token generator</a> to get an API Key and upload your images programatically.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that once you've generated a token, you have to store it somewhere safe, because it wont be visible ever again. You'll have to <a href="#tokenRegeneration">regenerate</a> it to get it again.</p>

    <h2>Basic POST</h2>
    <p>For the moment, the only way to upload an image is via POST request, this can be achieved by most languages/frameworks</p>
    <pre><code>curl --location 'https://img.capicua.org.es/api/image/upload/' \
      --header 'Authorization: API_TOKEN' \
      --form 'image=@"path/to/image"'</code></pre>

    <h2 id="tokenRegeneration">Token Regeneration</h2>
    <p>For security reasons you can only view the token the first time. After that, you'll have to regenerate it every time you dont have it, making the previous token obsolete.</p>
